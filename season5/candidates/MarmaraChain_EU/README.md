# Marmara Chain Notary Node Candidacy for EU Region 
<b>Marmara Credit Loops (MCL), the First and Only DeFi System of the World Designed to Run in Real Economy.</b> 

Marmara Credit Loops (MCL) is the first and the only Decentralized Finance (DeFi) system in the World designed to run in real economy. The system rewards buyers and sellers when shopping with credit loops instead of cash. It works as an independent smart chain with a 25% mineable and 75% stakeable coin integrated with two DeFi protocols. The system uses UTXO based Turing Complete Smart Contracting system powered by Komodo Platform.

## Region and Voting Address

- Region: `EU`
- Address: `RPrZFjD4FpZPmp3Y6xVKfcX8TZD6X1RuJr`

## Komodo Notary Node (NN) Proposal

- We propose our candidacy as Notary Node (NN) on behalf of Marmara Community. We are planning to manage Notary position in or nearby a Technopark either Marmara University or Komodo Office in Technopark Istanbul which is the greatest of technoparks in Turkey.
- We intend to spread end-to-end solutions of Komodo technologies to a very large audience and make Marmara Region a blockchain hub not only in Turkey but also in the middle-east region.
- Our adventure with Komodo started more than 3 years ago when we started seeking the best technology to solve the complex problems in post-dated cheques and promissory notes which currently work as analog blockchain existing on papers in Turkish economy. This problem is known as non-redemption.
They both do not only comprise nearly the half of GDP in Turkey but also in economies such as India, Middle East, etc where trust is a common culture in the society. The history and more staff may be found in (https://marmara.io/history)

- We form a community called Marmara taking the name from Marmara Region which alone makes up approximately 40% of GDP in country.
It took more than 1 year to develop the ideas on how to setup a blockchain version of sysytem that solves the the greatest problem, i.e. non-redemption and we know that without Komodo technologies and of course legendary leader James Lee those could not be implemented at all.
We made the first PoC’s with the codes developed by JL777 himself and tested among hundreds of students and some blockchain enthusiasts.
After so many tests we started the mainnet for Marmara Credit Loops Version 1 on 17th January 2020 as an event at Marmara University.


## Why Candidacy for Notary Node?

- The complexity and nature of Marmara Credit Loops requires our Marmara community get involved in many parts of end-to-end solutions in Komodo technologies. The notarization process will help understanding Komodo Technologies more and spread to word to all communities in Turkey. 
- The Protocol 2 in MCL requires escrows which is a kind of notarization system to settle down the nonredemption problem in p2p credits. The large level of experience via Notarization system in Komodo will help us settle the escrow system requirements. 
- The experience and reputation will help us to establish an educational center for developing Komodo way of Smart Contracts known as Crypto Conditions at Marmara University and technoparks.
- We strongly believe that Marmara community should and will be competent and strong to get involved in many potential projects in the near future by having talented people in Crypto Conditions, Smart Contracts by Komodo.
- We want to establish a center for teaching Komodo way of developing smart contracts by using CC Technologies for this purpose. Notarization is one of the key services for Komodo. Therefore, we feel that our community should be involved in this technology so that we can provide benefits of dPoW to other projects in region.
- Of course, all these will be possible if we can get enough votes from Komodo community. We believe that we will get support as before since otherwise would not be possible for us to initate a huge project named Marmara Credit Loops (MCL) which has a potential of trillion USD economy in the World.
- This year we like to involve more of universities and technoparks which we could not benefit last year due to pandemic limitations.

## About Marmara
The modern name "Marmara" is derived from the Greek μάρμαρον (marmaron) and that from μάρμαρος (mármaros), "crystalline rock", "shining stone", perhaps from the verb μαρμαίρω (marmaírō), "to flash, sparkle, gleam", because it was famous for the white marble quarried there.
Marmara is the region with the highest GDP in Turkey approaching nearly to 40%. Marmara University is one of the largest universities in Marmara Region with more than 90 thousand students.
Marmara Chain and Marmara Credit Loops (MCL) project was started as a joint project between Marmara Open Innovations Lab and Komodo Platform in 2018. The mainnet was opened on 17th January, 2020.
